# 🧶 Structured Power & Network Cabling

### **The "Color-Code" Standard**
I implement a color-coded cabling system to allow for "Instant Identification" during troubleshooting:
* **Blue/White:** Data (Copper Cat6a)
* **Yellow:** Single-Mode Fiber (OS2)
* **Aqua:** Multi-Mode Fiber (OM4)
* **Red/Black:** Power (A + B Redundancy)

### **Professional Labeling (TIA/EIA-606)**
I follow the **Source-to-Destination** labeling rule. Every cable has a wrap-around label at both ends:
> **Example Label:** `RU22-SW01-P15 / RU05-SRV02-NIC1`
> *(Rack 22, Switch 01, Port 15 TO Rack 05, Server 02, NIC 1)*



### **Cable Hygiene Practices**
* **Velcro vs. Zip Ties:** I exclusively use Velcro ties to prevent "kinking" or "pinching" of fiber and high-speed copper.
* **Vertical Management:** Routing all cables through vertical side-managers to keep the "Hot Aisle" clear of obstructions for maximum exhaust airflow.
* **Stress Relief:** Ensuring proper "Service Loops" are present so that servers can be pulled out on their rails without disconnecting.
