# 🎥 OBS Studio: Technical Knowledge Sharing

### **Use Case**
I utilize OBS Studio as a primary tool for **Knowledge Management**. By recording "How-to" videos for complex server configurations or troubleshooting workflows, I ensure that senior-level knowledge is preserved and easily shared with the team.

### **Workflows**
* **Screen Recording:** Capturing terminal sessions and web-UIs (Proxmox/Infoblox) for technical walkthroughs.
* **Scene Management:** Utilizing source overlays to highlight specific command-line outputs while presenting.
* **Standardization:** Recording standardized "Day 1" onboarding videos for common environment setups.
