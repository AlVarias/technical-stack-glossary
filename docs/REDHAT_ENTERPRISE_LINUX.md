# 🛡️ Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

### **Platform Overview**
RHEL is the industry standard for enterprise-grade stability and security. My experience focuses on **RHEL 8 and 9**, specifically within automated and cloud-orchestrated environments.

### **Core Competencies**
* **Package Management:** Expert use of `dnf` and `yum` for software lifecycle management.
* **Security & Compliance:** Managing **SELinux** policies, `firewalld` configurations, and OpenSCAP auditing.
* **Storage Management:** Configuring **LVM** (Logical Volume Management) and **Stratis** for flexible disk allocation.
* **Subscription Management:** Handling `subscription-manager` for satellite and cloud-based registrations.

### **Enterprise Workflow**
In my Red Hat training (**RHCSA/RH294**), I utilized RHEL as the base OS for **OpenStack** nodes and **Ansible** control nodes, ensuring 99.9% uptime through rigorous patching and kernel tuning.
