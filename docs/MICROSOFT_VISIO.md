# 📐 Microsoft Visio: Infrastructure Design & Topology

### **System Engineering Application**
I utilize Microsoft Visio as the primary tool for documenting and architecting complex network and server environments. Clear documentation is the foundation of high-availability systems.

### **Core Competencies**
* **Network Topology Mapping:** Designing detailed Layer 2 and Layer 3 diagrams for enterprise backbones, including Cisco and Mikrotik routing paths.
* **Rack Diagrams:** Creating 1:1 scale rack elevations to plan "Rack and Stack" deployments, ensuring efficient space, power, and cooling management.
* **Data Flow Diagrams:** Visualizing how data moves through the Infoblox DDI grid and F5 Load Balancers.
* **SOP Documentation:** Developing flowcharts for Incident Management and Change Request processes in ServiceNow.



### **Why it matters**
Accurate Visio diagrams reduce "Mean Time to Repair" (MTTR) by allowing the engineering team to visualize the physical and logical connections before touching the hardware.
