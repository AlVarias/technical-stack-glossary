### **Thermal Management Standards**
I manage the "Delta-T" (temperature difference) between the cold aisle and the hot aisle to ensure the highest efficiency for CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioning) units.

### **Applied Engineering**
* **Hot/Cold Aisle Containment:** Utilizing physical barriers (curtains or doors) to prevent the mixing of cold intake air and hot exhaust air.
* **Perforated Floor Tiles:** Strategically placing high-flow tiles only in front of server intakes.
* **Environmental Alerting:** Setting up threshold alerts (e.g., Warning at 24°C, Critical at 27°C) integrated into **ServiceNow**.
