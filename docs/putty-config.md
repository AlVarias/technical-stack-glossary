# 💻 Console Management with PuTTY

### **Use Case**
PuTTY is my primary terminal emulator for Windows-to-Linux management and serial console access for hardware-level configuration (Switches/Routers/Hypervisors).

### **Key Configurations**
* **SSH Tunneling (L3 Proxy):** Setting up Local/Remote port forwarding to access internal web UIs (like Proxmox or Pi-hole) through a single secure SSH gateway.
* **Serial Connection:** Used for 'Headless' server setup (115200 Baud Rate) when the network stack is not yet configured.
* **Logging:** Enabling "All session output" logging for audit trails during critical infrastructure changes.
