# 🏗️ Server Rack & Stack Operations

### **Standardized Deployment Logic**
I manage physical hardware deployment using a "Density-First" approach, ensuring that heavy equipment (UPS/Storage) is placed at the bottom (U1-U10) to maintain a low center of gravity.

### **Labeling & Documentation Standard**
* **Asset ID:** Every chassis is labeled with a unique ID (e.g., `AKL-SRV-001`) on both the front and rear.
* **RU Mapping:** Documenting the exact Rack Unit (RU) position in **Microsoft Visio** to ensure "Single Source of Truth."
* **Rail Installation:** Utilizing sliding "RapidRails" for tool-less deployment and static rails for heavy-duty storage arrays.



### **Applied Experience**
Optimized the physical layout of a 42U rack by implementing **Blanking Panels** in unused spaces to force cold air through the active server inlets, reducing intake temperatures by 4°C.
