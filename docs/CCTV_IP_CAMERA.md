# 📹 CCTV & IP Camera Infrastructure

### **System Engineering Application**
I manage the end-to-end deployment of IP-based surveillance systems, bridging the gap between physical security and network infrastructure.

### **Core Competencies**
* **Network Integration:** Provisioning dedicated VLANs and POE (Power over Ethernet) switching for high-definition IP camera streams.
* **NVR/VMS Configuration:** Setting up Network Video Recorders and Video Management Software for 24/7 recording and remote monitoring.
* **Bandwidth Optimization:** Utilizing **Harmony** or native H.265 compression to manage the high data throughput required for 4K surveillance without impacting the core business network.
* **Hardware Maintenance:** Physical installation, focal length adjustment, and troubleshooting of PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) and fixed-dome cameras.



### **Applied Experience**
Managed the integration of surveillance hardware into the existing IT framework, ensuring secure access control and data retention compliance.
