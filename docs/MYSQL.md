### **Technology Overview**
The world's most popular open-source database, used as the backbone for web applications and cloud services.

### **Core Competencies**
* **Query Optimization:** Writing and tuning SQL queries for efficient data retrieval.
* **Database Migrations:** Exporting and importing large datasets using `mysqldump` and CLI tools.
* **User Management:** Configuring host-based access control and encrypted connections.
* **Troubleshooting:** Analyzing slow-query logs and system metrics to identify performance bottlenecks.

### **Enterprise Workflow**
My experience with MySQL spans across multiple Linux distributions, where I have managed the "M" in the **LAMP/LEMP** stack to support web-based monitoring tools and internal documentation platforms.
