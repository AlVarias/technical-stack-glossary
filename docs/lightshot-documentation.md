# 📸 Lightshot: Instant Technical Documentation

### **Use Case**
Platform Engineers must provide visual evidence of issues. I use Lightshot for rapid, high-precision screenshots during **Incident Handling** and **Documentation**.

### **Professional Application**
* **RCA Evidence:** Quickly highlighting error logs or malformed networking packets to include in Jira or ServiceNow tickets.
* **Instructional Guides:** Adding arrows and text annotations to screenshots to create "Self-Help" guides for end-users.
* **Rapid Sharing:** Utilizing instant uploads to provide real-time visual feedback to senior engineers during critical outages.
