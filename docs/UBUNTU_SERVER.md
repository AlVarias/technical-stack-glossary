# 🟠 Ubuntu Server

### **Platform Overview**
Ubuntu is the preferred platform for modern cloud-native applications and fast-paced DevOps environments. I utilize Ubuntu for container hosting and rapid prototyping.

### **Core Competencies**
* **Package Management:** Advanced use of `apt` and `dpkg`, including managing PPA repositories.
* **Container Optimization:** Configuring Ubuntu as a lightweight host for **Docker** and **Kubernetes** (OpenShift nodes).
* **Networking:** Expertise in **Netplan** for YAML-based network configuration (essential for Ubuntu 18.04+).
* **Cloud-Init:** Utilizing Cloud-Init scripts for automated mass-deployment in virtualized environments.

### **Enterprise Workflow**
I leverage Ubuntu Server for high-performance applications that benefit from the latest upstream kernels and the massive community-driven package ecosystem.
