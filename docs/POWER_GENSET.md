# ⚡ Critical Power: Generators & UPS Systems

### **Redundancy Logic (2N / N+1)**
I manage power paths to ensure no single point of failure (SPOF) exists between the Utility Grid and the Server Power Supply.

### **System Components**
* **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply):** Battery-backed protection against sags, swells, and momentary outages. 
* **ATS (Automatic Transfer Switch):** The "Brain" that detects utility loss and commands the Genset to start.
* **PDU (Power Distribution Unit):** Labeled `PDU-A` and `PDU-B` to ensure every server has dual power feeds.



### **Applied Experience**
Maintained a strict **PM (Preventative Maintenance)** schedule for the Diesel Generator, including monthly "No-Load" runs and quarterly "Full-Load" transfers to ensure the 100% availability of the Auckland data site.
