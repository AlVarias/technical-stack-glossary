# 🦭 MariaDB Administration

### **Technology Overview**
A community-developed, commercially supported fork of MySQL, commonly used as a drop-in replacement in high-performance Linux environments.

### **Core Competencies**
* **Deployment:** Installing and configuring MariaDB on RHEL, CentOS, and Ubuntu platforms.
* **Security Hardening:** Utilizing `mysql_secure_installation` and managing restricted user privileges.
* **Storage Engines:** Working with **InnoDB** for reliable transaction processing and data recovery.
* **Red Hat Integration:** Experience managing MariaDB as the backend database for **OpenStack** and **OpenShift** infrastructure services.

### **Platform Engineering Logic**
I utilize MariaDB in my automation lab for lightweight, high-speed data storage where open-source compliance and RHEL-compatibility are high priorities.
