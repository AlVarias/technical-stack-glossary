# 📡 AnyDesk: Remote Support & Desktop Management

### **Use Case**
AnyDesk is utilized for providing remote technical assistance and accessing headless workstations where SSH is unavailable.

### **Best Practices**
* **Unattended Access:** Configuring secure, password-protected access for remote management of administrative nodes.
* **Security Hardening:** Implementing 'Access Control Lists' to ensure only authorized IDs can request a connection.
* **Resource Optimization:** Utilizing "Direct Connection" mode to minimize latency during remote troubleshooting sessions.
