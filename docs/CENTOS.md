# 🌀 CentOS (Community Enterprise Operating System)

### **Platform Overview**
CentOS serves as the open-source downstream (and now upstream via Stream) version of RHEL. I utilize CentOS for cost-effective staging environments that require RHEL binary compatibility.

### **Core Competencies**
* **Migration & Compatibility:** Experience in managing the transition from CentOS 7/8 to CentOS Stream or Rocky/AlmaLinux.
* **Web & Database Hosting:** Utilizing CentOS as a stable platform for **MySQL/MariaDB** and **Apache/Nginx** stacks.
* **Legacy Support:** Maintaining older CentOS 7 environments, including custom kernel compilations and backported security fixes.

### **Enterprise Workflow**
I have deployed CentOS in various lab and production environments where RHEL-like stability was required without the overhead of enterprise licensing, specifically for non-critical internal tool hosting.
